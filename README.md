Research Question: How accurate are classifier algorithms: Logistic Regression and Naive Byes in classifying hate speech tweets?

#Experimental Procedure:
Our experimental procedure is as presented below:
Firstly, the kaggle datset will undergo data pre-processing in order to balance the skew
of having non-hate labelled tweets as the majority class. Before conducting data
analysis, the kaggle dataset must be cleaned of any inaccurate, corrupt, or useless data.
Then, “bag of words”, a Natural Processing Langauge (NLP) technique will be applied in
order to extract features from tweets to understand what features of tweets cause them
to be offensive or not. NLP techniques like a bag of words are applied in order to extract
features from the data that can be used in modeling the ML algorithms (Towards Data
Science). Next, ML algorithms, Logistic regression and Naive byes are trained and
modeled on the dataset after which their training accuracy will be recorded.
